            Abdul Sattar Edhi was born in 1928 in a small village of Bantva near Joona Garh, Gujrat (India). 
            The seeds of compassion for the suffering humanity were sown in his soul by his motherâ€™s infirmity. 
            When Edhi was at the tender age of eleven, his mother became paralysed and later got mentally ill. 
            Young Abdul Sattar devoted himself for looking after all her needs; cleaning, bathing, changing clothes and feeding. 
            This proved to be a losing battle against the disease, and her helplessness increased over the years.
