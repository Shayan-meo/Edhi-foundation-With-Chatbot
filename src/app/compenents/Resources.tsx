                    Problems faced by the developed and the developing countries in the area of welfare services
                    demand radically different approaches. Whereas, the developed countries are putting the
                    responsibility primarily on the government, the developing countries are struggling to mobilise
                    their own resources or look for foreign assistance for this purpose.
